I am Xinpeng Wei, a senior undergraduate from Shanghai Jiao Tong University majoring in software engineering system software track.

Now I am a research assistant at Northeastern University [systems research group](http://srg.khoury.northeastern.edu/) advised by [Pro. Cheng Tan](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/cheng-tan/). Before joining NEU, I was a research assistant at Shanghai Jiao Tong University [institute of parallel and distributed systems(IPADS)](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/) advised by [Pro. Yubin Xia](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/yubin_xia) and [Ph.D. Mingyu Li](https://maxul.github.io).

Also, I did a summer intership at Microsoft Dynamics 365 as a software engineer intern. Before joining Microsoft, I was a database system R&D intern at [RisingWave Labs](https://www.risingwave-labs.com/) fortunately enough to be advised by [Alex Chi](https://www.skyzh.dev) and [Tianyi](https://blog.zhuangty.com).
