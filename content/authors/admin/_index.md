I am Xinpeng Wei, a first year master student from Georgia Institute of Technology majoring in Computer Science. Before that, I received my B.E. degree in Software Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Currently my research interest lies in building robust and scalable systems for large-scale machine learning workloads like large language model (LLM). Specifically, I'm dedicating myself to high-performance/parallel computing (CUDA), ML frameworks (PyTorch), and other fancy technologies in this exciting field.

I consider myself extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to work at some outstanding companies, laboratories, and receive mentorship from supportive and insightful advisers. Check my [Work Experience](#work_experience) and [Research Experience](#research_experience).
